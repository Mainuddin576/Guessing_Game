# Guessing_Game
This is a simple Python program where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it. After each guess, the program provides hints — whether the guess should be higher or lower — until the correct number is guessed. It also keeps track of the total number of attempts taken by the player.
